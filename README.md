## C Algorithms

The C programming language includes a very limited standard library in
comparison to other modern programming languages. This is a collection of
common computer science data structures and algorithms which may be used in C
projects.

The code is licensed under the [ISC license](COPYING.md), a permissive license
that is functionally identical to the MIT or BSD licenses. As such, it may
legitimately be reused in any project, whether proprietary or open source.
